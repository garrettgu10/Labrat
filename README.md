# Labrat
A Java game that tests your mouse SKILLZ.  

NOTICE:  
For security reasons, a public class named "secrets" is excluded from the source.  
If you want to play online, you can download and use the jar file.  

If you want to build it to run offline, create src/secrets.java and include:  
```java  
public class secrets{  
  static String host = "bogusURL328934.com";  
  static String salt = "";  
}
```

I will upload source code for the server if demand is high enough.
